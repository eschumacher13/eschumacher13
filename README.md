Hello!

This portfolio showcases some projects that I have worked on. Professionally, I love to help companies analyze their data to enhance their business decisions. Personally, I like working on data projects that revolve around video games, Disney (or theme parks in general), and the general entertainment industry. Currently I am very interested in learning more about UX design and hoping to broaden my portfolio with some fun new skills!
